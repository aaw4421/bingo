# Bingo

Serving Minecraft bingo boards through GitHub Pages

Based on ootbingo

## Development

Browsers have restricted local development, so opening local HTML files no longer works properly. For easy development, there is a server that will staticly host your
files. You will need to install [Node](https://nodejs.org) to run it

```
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:3000/bingo/
